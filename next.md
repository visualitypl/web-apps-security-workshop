# What else I can do to improve myself?

## Studying part

1. You can continue learning about OWASP top 10 by reading more at [OWASP website](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_Top_10)
2. You can watch some YT videos based on the knowledge shared by OWASP if you prefer videos over reading: [ENG playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWHvp7rUka8&list=PLyqga7AXMtPPuibxp1N0TdyDrKwP9H_jD&index=1) / [PL playlist (incomplete)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HdGkshOoOg&index=1&list=PLS4wD4sorSGC8j8Gln4IVyUqVZpkIE0Rp)

## Practice

There's a Google Gruyere (https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/) project which allows you to challenge yourself and learn more in practice. I highly recommend playing with it. Just follow the instructions. In this platform, there'll be a separate instance of the app created for each of you so you can play with the app in separated environment.

Gruyere is written in Python but this shouldn't be a problem. Even without any experience in Python you'll learn a lot because huge part of the challenges don't require looking at the Python code :)
